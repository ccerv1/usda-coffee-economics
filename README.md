# USDA Coffee Economics

The USDA maintains an incredible, free database of global commodity statistics here. It includes data about coffee production, exports, and imports for 83 countries, going all the way back to 1961. It’s been a jumping-off point for much of the analytical work I’ve done in the coffee sector over the past decade.

You can access it here: https://apps.fas.usda.gov/psdonline/downloads/psd_coffee_csv.zip

This repo automatesdata extraction from the USDA’s website and provides some examples of data manipulation and visualizations.
